# CS-230 The Gaming Room's Draw It or Lose It
<p><br /><strong>Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? </strong></p>

The Gaming Room is creating a game application called Draw It or Lose It (based on their current android game application). This new game application would be a web application and capable of operating on Windows, Linux, Mac, and Mobile Devices. The game consists of one or multiple teams, with each team having multiple players assigned to it. Each team is provided a rendered HD drawing that are fully complete at the 30-second mark. If the team does not guess the correct answer to the puzzle, the other teams will be given 15 seconds to provide the correct answer. 

<p><br /><strong>What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?</strong></p>

The best section for the documentation within the STD was the recommendations section. I took extra care to ensure the specifics of the programs/user’s needs were met.

<p><br /><strong>What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?</strong></p>

The design document provides a useful framework to highlight the key necessities of a given program. It underlines the important features requested by the client, as well as provide insight for any programmer working on the aforementioned project.

<p><br /><strong>If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?</strong></p>

The design constraints and requirements I created for the Draw It or Lose it application would by my pick for revision. The requirements I outlined were more options and scope expansion versus client-underlined requirements. My design constraints didn’t provide enough context to what I was suggesting. Thus both of these sections should be revised.

<p><br /><strong>How did you interpret the user&rsquo;s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user&rsquo;s needs when designing?</strong></p>

Once the user needs were correctly interpreted, I made design constraints and recommendations regarding key aspects of the game application. These recommendations and constraints were specifically catered towards the user’s needs to create a successful web-game application, which is what the client The Gaming Room wanted.
The user’s needs are vital to any successful application. As users of the application are the base for why the application is being made in the first place, the user’s needs are undoubtedly an important consideration (if not the primary consideration). If the user is comfortable and able to enjoy the application, they will continue to use it and the application will survive through popularity.

<p><br /><strong>How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?</strong></p>

I believe originally approaching the STD document there were some bumps in regards to the specifics of the document itself. Yet, as the revisions went forward, I believe I began to better understand the document. I believe a great strategy for the STD is to be very careful and specific to what each section is requesting. Don’t be verbose and don’t stray away from the original question/request.
