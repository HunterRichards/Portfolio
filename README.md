# CS-210 Clock Project
<br><b>Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.</b></br>

This project required the creation of a basic clock in both 12-hour format & 24 hour format using (ISO8601). It further required the ability to adjust the clock via a menu section as well as an exit function.

<br><b>What did you do particularly well?</b></br>

I felt as though I made the clock well enough (up to the requirements). I also added the feature of a wait tick that updates the clock every second. Furthermore, I ensured a majority of the code was outside of the main function but rather modularized within functions/classes.

<br><b>Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?</b></br>

Better UI and menu options could absolutely enhance the code. It could be better utilized by the engineering company. Likewise, getting the code outside of the console environment and into some standardized application environment would make the code more useful and powerful.

<br><b>Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are 
 you adding to your support network?</b></br>
 
Overall, the code wasn’t too difficult to write/program. The most difficult part was breaking down the most efficient way to store the clock time in a way that could be utilized by the different time formats in unison (which ended up being storing the total seconds). Having the time breakdown is definitely a useful tool that could be used in future programs. That comes with the beauty of OOP.
 
<br><b>What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?</b></br>

Creating a program in C++ for the first time was definitely a unique experience that I won’t forgot. That will be the most useful takeaway from this endeavor, which in and of its self is invaluable as C++ is an industry leading programing language (along with Python and Java)

<br><b>How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?</b></br>

By adding inline comments that described each section of the program as well as modularizing the code into different functions. These functions allow you to utilize OOP principles, thus permitting modularity of the declared functions (as well as better readability/adaptability/maintainability).
