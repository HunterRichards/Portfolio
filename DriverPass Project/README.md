# CS-255 DriverPass Project

<br><b>Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?</b></br>

DriverPass, the client of this project, is seeking to build a web-based application. This application will handle major pieces of the operations surrounding the DriverPass company. Their operations include on-the-road training, practice tests, learning materials about practice driving, DMV related information. 
<br>
This project, in particular, revolves around features that will be presented in a designed user framework provided by the client. The features will include online practice tests, virtual classroom/training materials, practice driving scheduling, user/driver related info, and updated DMV related information.

<br><b>What did you do particularly well?</b></br>

I believe I made the business design document and UML diagrams fairly well. I took my time to ensure each section/diagram was filled out correctly, in-line with the required design.

<br><b>If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?</b></br>

If I could improve one part of my work it would be the DriverPass Use Case Diagram. Although I do believe I captured most of the intended use cases, there were definitely some missing from my diagram. Furthuremore, my diagram is a bit of a mess with lines going all over the place (which is not very aesthetically pleasing). Therefore I would adjust my diagram to include all use cases within the DriverPass platform. I would also re-design the layout of the diagram to be more aesthetically pleasing (without line going behind use case bubbles).

<br><b>How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?</b></br>

I interpreted the users needs based off of the interview transcript that was provided for this project. I carefully broke down the intentions of the users needs and ensured they were implemented into the system design. This is vitally important for any project as the whole project is funded and based around the user and their needs. Thus, if the user is unhappy, they will not be contracting your company in the future (and possibly not recommened your services to other companies). However, the oposite is true if the user's needs are fullfilled successfully.

<br><b>How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?</b></br>

Especially from this class, it has shown the importance of documenting system design. The entire process becomes far easier to understand, deliniate, and provide useful insight into deadlines/work-load. Therefore, I would definitely use Use Case Diagrams and Business Requirement documents in the future when designing software. This will greatly assist in analyzing current systems and provide useful strategies to implement new features/software.
