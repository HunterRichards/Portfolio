# Reflection on CS-370 Final Project

## Summary of the Project and Problem It Solved

The final project for CS-370 involved developing a pirate intelligent agent using reinforcement learning and neural networks to solve a pathfinding problem within a maze. The primary objective was to create a deep Q-learning algorithm that would enable the pirate agent to navigate an 8x8 maze, avoiding obstacles and reaching the treasure before the human player. The project was divided into several key components, including the environment setup, experience replay, model building, and Q-training algorithm. I was provided with starter code that included the environment (TreasureMaze) and experience replay (GameExperience) classes, as well as some basic functions for model building and game simulation. My primary task was to implement the deep Q-learning algorithm, which involved completing the Q-training function and ensuring the agent learned to find the optimal path to the treasure efficiently.

## Connecting Learning to the Larger Field of Computer Science

### What Do Computer Scientists Do and Why Does It Matter?

Computer scientists solve complex problems by designing and implementing algorithms, developing software systems, and leveraging computational techniques to address real-world challenges. In this project, the use of deep Q-learning demonstrated how computer scientists apply machine learning techniques to develop intelligent systems capable of making decisions autonomously. This work is crucial in advancing technology, as it enables the creation of systems that can adapt, learn, and improve over time, thereby solving problems that are too complex for traditional programming approaches.

### How Do I Approach a Problem as a Computer Scientist?

As a computer scientist, I approach problems systematically, beginning with a thorough understanding of the problem domain, followed by the design of an appropriate algorithm or model. In this project, I started by analyzing the maze environment and the requirements for the pirate agent. I then implemented the deep Q-learning algorithm, continuously refining the model through experimentation and evaluation. This approach involved breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable components, iterating on the solution, and using data-driven methods to optimize the agent's performance.

### What Are My Ethical Responsibilities to the End User and the Organization?

Ethically, computer scientists must ensure that the systems they develop are reliable, safe, and free from bias. In the context of this project, it was important to design the intelligent agent in a way that ensured fair play and did not exploit unintended loopholes in the maze. Additionally, as the developer, I was responsible for maintaining transparency in the algorithm's decision-making process, ensuring that the agent's actions could be explained and justified. This is critical in building trust with the end users and ensuring that the system aligns with the values and objectives of the organization.

## Conclusion

Reflecting on the work done in this project, I have gained a deeper understanding of how reinforcement learning and neural networks can be applied to solve complex problems in computer science. The hands-on experience of developing an intelligent agent that learns to navigate a maze has reinforced my ability to approach problems methodically and ethically. This project not only showcased the practical application of theoretical concepts but also highlighted the importance of continuous learning and adaptation in the ever-evolving field of computer science.
