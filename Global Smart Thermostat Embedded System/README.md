# Reflection on CS-350 Final Project

## Summary of the Project and Problem It Solved

The final project involved developing an embedded system using a microcontroller interfaced with I2C sensors, a timer, UART for communication, and GPIO peripherals for input (buttons) and output (LEDs). The primary goal of the project was to create a responsive and efficient temperature control system. The embedded system read temperatures from an I2C sensor, adjusted heating elements via GPIO outputs based on desired setpoints altered by button inputs, and communicated system status through UART, thereby solving the problem of maintaining a specified environmental temperature in a controlled setting.

## Strengths and Achievements

One aspect that I handled particularly well was the integration and management of different hardware components using the microcontroller. The successful setup and synchronization of the UART, I2C, and GPIO interfaces along with precise timer configurations underscored my ability to develop a cohesive system that operates reliably and efficiently. Additionally, I excelled in writing clean, modular code which helped in making the system easy to understand and maintain.

## Areas for Improvement

While the project was successful, there were areas where I could improve. Specifically, the initial design phase could be streamlined. I spent considerable time troubleshooting issues that could have been avoided with a more detailed initial plan, especially concerning the interdependencies between different components like timers and sensor readings. Improving my upfront planning and design skills will enable smoother project executions in the future.

## Tools and Resources Added to Support Network

Throughout this project, I utilized several tools and resources that I plan to keep in my support network. Documentation for Texas Instruments microcontrollers and their peripherals proved invaluable and will undoubtedly assist in future projects. Additionally, forums such as Stack Overflow and the TI E2E support community were critical in resolving specific technical challenges. I've also learned to make effective use of datasheets and hardware manuals, which are essential for understanding the specifics of components used in embedded systems.

## Transferable Skills

The skills developed during this project are highly transferable to other projects and coursework. The ability to integrate hardware and software to build functional systems can be applied to virtually any technology-driven project. Skills in reading and applying technical documentation, programming microcontrollers, debugging complex systems, and designing for specific functionality are relevant across many areas of computer science and engineering.

## Ensuring Maintainability, Readability, and Adaptability

To make the project maintainable, readable, and adaptable, I adhered to several best practices. First, I maintained a clear and consistent coding style, using comments and documentation to explain the purpose and functionality of code segments. Modular programming was another focus, where I structured the code so that each component could be tested and modified independently. This not only simplified debugging but also enhanced the adaptability of the system to different sensors and peripherals without extensive rewrites. Lastly, by defining clear interfaces and using configuration files, I ensured that adapting the system to new requirements would be as straightforward as possible, supporting future enhancements or adjustments with minimal effort.

## Conclusion

Reflecting on these aspects not only demonstrates the depth of engagement with the project but also reinforces the learning outcomes, making them more applicable to future endeavors in both academic and professional settings.
