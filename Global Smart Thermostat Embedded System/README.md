# CS-350 Final Project - Embedded Temperature Control System

## Project Overview

This project was developed as part of the CS-350 course, focusing on creating an efficient and responsive temperature control system. Utilizing a microcontroller interfaced with I2C sensors, timers, UART for communication, and GPIO peripherals, the system manages environmental temperatures by reading sensor data, adjusting heating elements, and providing system status updates through UART.

## Problem Solved

The primary goal of this project was to maintain a specified environmental temperature in a controlled setting. This was achieved by developing an embedded system that can read temperatures, adjust outputs based on user inputs, and communicate statuses effectively.

## Highlights of My Work

- **Integration and Management of Hardware Components**: I effectively managed the integration of UART, I2C, and GPIO interfaces along with precise timer configurations, ensuring that the system worked seamlessly and efficiently.
- **Code Quality**: The code was written in a clean, modular fashion which made the system easy to understand, maintain, and extend.

## Areas for Improvement

- **Initial Design and Planning**: The design phase could be improved by incorporating more detailed planning, especially around component interdependencies. This could reduce troubleshooting time and streamline project execution.

## Tools and Resources

- **Documentation and Forums**: I utilized Texas Instruments microcontroller documentation, Stack Overflow, and the TI E2E support community extensively. These resources were invaluable for resolving technical challenges.
- **Technical Manuals and Datasheets**: Essential tools for understanding hardware specifics, and they will continue to be crucial in future projects.

## Transferable Skills

- **Hardware and Software Integration**: The ability to integrate and program hardware components is universally applicable in technology-driven projects.
- **Technical Documentation**: Skills in interpreting and applying technical documentation are crucial across various fields of computer science and engineering.

## Code Maintainability, Readability, and Adaptability

- **Best Practices**: I adhered to best practices such as maintaining a consistent coding style, thorough commenting, and modular programming.
- **Configuration Files**: Using configuration files facilitated making the system adaptable to changing requirements with minimal code changes.

## Conclusion

Reflecting on this project has not only solidified my understanding but also highlighted the importance of systematic planning, thorough documentation, and community engagement in successfully executing technology projects. I look forward to applying these skills and insights to future challenges.
