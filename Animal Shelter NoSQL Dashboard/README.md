# CS-340 Animal Shelter NoSQL Dashboard
<br>How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?</b></br>

Artemis Financial was looking for a secure way to validate files using a secure hashing algorithm. It was my job to identify the correct algorithm for their use case, implement the algorithm, and showcase its functioning state. Artemis also requested that the communication between client and server utilize strong security policies. The process of securing the site involved creating a HTTPS certificate (for secure handshakes), dependency verification through static testing, and secondary testing which implemented secure coding practices.

<br><b>How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?</b></br>

I believe I implemented the algorithm cipher very well. This involved choosing a hashing algorithm, SHA-256 in this instance, and then implementing the hashing algorithm on a string input. The data was then converted from a hash value to a hexadecimal one for the valid checksum.
Coding securely is essential for data integrity, company integrity, and a better/safer consumer/business experience. This, in essence, protects the company’s well-being by mitigating data-breaches and malicious actors, which could cause litigious action against the company (not including the irreparable harm to the company’s identity/brand).

<br><b>What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?</b></br>

The algorithm choice and implementation (both for Project 1 where AES-256 was chosen & Project 2 where SHA-256 was chosen) were what I found most useful. To see it work in practice, versus theory, helped me obtain a better grasp of the concepts in this course.
