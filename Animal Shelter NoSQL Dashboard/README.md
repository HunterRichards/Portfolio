# CS-340 Animal Shelter NoSQL Dashboard
<br><b>How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?</b></br>

Writing maintainable, readable, and adaptable programs is crucial for the longevity and usability of software. In the context of the provided code, the use of a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) Python module for database operations is a good practice for achieving these goals. The advantages of this approach include modularity, as the database operations are encapsulated in a class, making it easy to reuse in other parts of the project or even in future projects. This promotes code reusability and reduces redundancy. Additionally, the use of meaningful function names like 'create, 'read, 'update, and 'delete improves code readability, making it clear what each method does. The class's constructor also centralizes the database connection details, making it easier to manage and update them in one place. In the future, this CRUD Python module can be reused in different parts of the project or in other projects where MongoDB database operations are required, saving time and effort in development.

<br><b>How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?</b></br>

As a computer scientist, approaching problems involves a systematic and analytical mindset. In the case of the database and dashboard requirements for Grazioso Salvare, the approach begins with understanding the client's needs and requirements thoroughly. The use of a dedicated Python module for database operations, such as the CRUD module in this code, demonstrates a structured and modular approach to data handling. This approach differs from previous assignments as it involves interacting with a MongoDB database and creating a dashboard interface using Dash and Plotly. In the future, when faced with similar tasks, techniques and strategies would include thorough requirements analysis, database schema design, code modularity, and the use of suitable libraries and frameworks for building interactive dashboards.

<br><b>What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?</b></br>

Computer scientists play a critical role in solving real-world problems by leveraging technology and programming skills. In this specific project, computer science contributes to Grazioso Salvare's ability to manage and analyze data effectively. The Python CRUD module facilitates the interaction with the database, enabling the company to store and retrieve data efficiently. The Jupyter Dashboard module, built using Dash and Plotly, provides a user-friendly interface for visualizing and interacting with the data, which can be invaluable for decision-making. Overall, the work on this project empowers Grazioso Salvare to streamline their operations, make data-driven decisions, and potentially improve their services, demonstrating the tangible impact of computer science on a company's effectiveness and efficiency.
